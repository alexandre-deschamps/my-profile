				<h3>My 3 most important passions</h3>

				<p>
				I love skiing, and I mean love a lot. I have always skied in my life from the time I could barely walk. Having a house in the Alps was a great help for my skills. As I started very young and was quite good for my age, I was put in more advanced classes, in order to learn a maximum from everyone. I did several regional competitions starting at 8, and was quite good. At the age of 12, during the weekend between the two weeks of holidays of february, a drama occurred. I fell at a consequent speed in a track, breaking my left shoulder. I went to the hospital in the nearest city and stayed for a week there. I tried to come back to competitions but my level wasn't high enough anymore, with having difficulties with high speed after my accident. I decided to concentrate myself on the technical part of the ski, with the special slalom, which is for some the most difficult trail of slalom. I somehow managed to stay at a decent level throughout the years and was offered a place in the sport etudes program. I declined because I was'nt ready to leave my home and my friends. I am now skiing for my utmost pleasure and started going off tracks (with the correct equipment and while looking at the weather beforehand).<br>

				On my 16's birthdays, i was offered my first piloting course, as I loved planes for an early age. I immediately fell in love with piloting and am currently doing my PPL (private pilot license) in order to pilot by myself whenever I want.<br>

				I am a true manga fan. By that i mean that i possess an imaginable amount of manga, more than 500, for different authors and genders. My favorite manga being One Piece, I have the 98 books that came out in France. My latest favorite is Berserk, I forced myself to continue to read this masterpiece even if its creator died not long ago.<br>
